Project to combine Rails backend w/ React-redux frontend. Objectives:

• Create a file system to structure and configure your front end

• Generate a Redux store to manage your application's global front end state

• Implement a reducer to route different action types to interact with the Redux store in different ways

• Set up Redux actions and action creators

• Implement a full Redux loop for todos and todo steps

• Use debuggers and bootstrapping to manually test each part of your Redux structure

• Use the store.getState method to access the data stored in the Redux store

• Use the store.dispatch method to dispatch actions to the Redux store

•Set up React to replace your static HTML page

•Configure a Root component to provide your other components with access to the Redux store

•Build presentational and container components to render todos and their steps

•Build controlled components to render forms for creating todos and their steps

•Create a Rails API that stores todos and serves JSON via HTTP responses

•Write AJAX requests to communicate between the front and back end

•Write thunk middleware and action creators to asynchronously dispatch actions

•Implement error handling to deal with rejected HTTP requests

•Add tags to todos
